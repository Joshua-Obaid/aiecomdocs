## Usage

The usage of the AI Ecommerce Store Generator revolves around a credit-based system. Upon subscribing to one of the available packages, users are allocated a specific number of credits. These credits can then be utilized to prompt the AI to generate a fully functional ecommerce store based on the user's specifications.

Creating an ecommerce store is as simple as providing a prompt that outlines the desired niche, target audience, and any specific features or design preferences. The AI Ecommerce Store Generator takes this input and leverages its deep learning capabilities to produce a store that aligns with the user's vision.
